### Create your own

In your Image Manipulation Programm, create 3 - X of the same Form with the same Color. Now try to shift the Value and the Saturation of each of the new Forms, without changing the HUE to create a Monochromatic Color-Scheme.

Try to experiment with different sizes between the Forms, different amounts of Forms with the two Colors or with Placement of those Forms and see how the Relation between the Colors changes.
