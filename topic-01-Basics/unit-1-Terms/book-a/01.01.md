# HUE

The HUE describes the Color-part of the Color.
Some examples for HUEs are Red, Green or Blue.
They are generally synomimous with Names for Colors, which describe a broader Group, but actually refer to only a single Color Value, usually describeb through RGB- or CMYK-Codes.

The HUE is represented by the outer Part of the Color-Wheel.
