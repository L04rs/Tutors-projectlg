Some simple Excercises to apply the Terms we just learned.

## Exercise 1:

Open your Image Manipulation Programm  of choice (Paint, Illustrator) and create a new empty Project. In that Project, add a Form and shift its HUE over the Color-Picker.

## Exercise 2:

Now duplicate the Form in the current Color. Try making one Form more saturated and the other less saturated than the original.

## Exercise 3:

Now duplicate each Form twice again. Add Tint to one of each of the new Forms and add Shade to on of each of the others.
Look at the finish results and describe the differences.
